Mikasa Ackermann (ミカサ・アッカーマン Mikasa Akkāman?) is one of the two deuteragonists of the series.<br>
 She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island,<br>
  thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru. <br>

After her mother and father were murdered by bandits, Mikasa was rescued by Eren.
<br> She lived with him and his parents for approximately one year before the Fall of Wall Maria. <br>

                 Eren was born and raised in Shiganshina District, which is located on the southern edge*<br>
                  of Wall Maria.
                 <br> He lived there until the year 845, when the Colossal and Armored Titans breached the Wall,

  <br> to being exposed and defeated by the Scout Regiment. After her defeat, she crystallized herself and
  <br> was left in a comatose state. She was held underground for approximately four years 
  <br>before escaping during a battle between the Military, the Jaegerists, and the forces of Marley.[

    Hange Zoë (ハンジ・ゾエ Hanji Zoe?, also translated as Hans Zoe) was the 14th and current Commander
    <br> (団長 Danchō?) of the Scout Regiment, formerly a section commander (分隊長 Bun-taichō?) in charge 
    <br>of the Fourth Squad, until the death of the 13th Commander - Erwin Smith -
    <br> who named Hange as his successor shortly before. Hange conducted research on Titans to
    <br> the point of being obsessed with them. As a result, they were deeply interested in
    <br> Eren Jaeger and his ability to transform into a Titan.

<p  class="text-white-50"  style="width: 100%;">Hange is among the many surprised recruits present when Levi, Isabel Magnolia, and Furlan Church are introduced to the Scout Regiment as new recruits.
     Along with Moblit, Hange enthusiastically watches Levi demonstrate his omni-directional 
  mobility gear skills during training, commenting on how individual skill and style weigh in on performance 
   and outcomes in battle. Hange is impatiently waiting to leave Trost District for the 49th expedition outside
   the Walls, wanting to capture a Titan to study. Hange tries to convince Levi and Miche Zacharius to help them capture 
    one but they both dismiss them. After the expedition has begun, Hange attempts to convince the commander, Erwin Smith,
    to authorize a Titan capture operation, but he refuses. They then take their frustration out on Oruo Bozad,
   telling him how important it is to study targets if they are going to win while choking him.

<p   class="text-white-50">The march of Eren Jaeger and the Wall Titans reaches the Marleyan city of Liberio, killing most of its people, though some survivors escape. Eren has known since he first arrived in Marley that he would one day flatten this city, and feels trapped by a future he cannot change because to behave differently would not be in his nature. Despite this, he calls his friends into the Paths in order to tell them that there can be no compromise so long as their stances are unwavering. The only thing left is for them to fight.

    The combined group of surviving Scouts and Warriors manage to get the flying boat fueled and prepared at Odiha, but not without a costly delay caused by Floch Forster. Hange Zoë fights the approaching Titans alone to buy the group time, handing command over to Armin Arlelt. The group catches up with Eren near Fort Salta, one of the last bastions of humanity in Marley. Following a failed bombing run by the Marleyan military, the Scouts and Warriors jump from the flying boat and on to the back of Eren's Founding Titan.</p>
